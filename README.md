# Global Water Access Analysis Project

## Author: Aimad Sadouk

## Description
In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on global water access data, examining key metrics like urbanisation, reliance on surface and unimproved water sources, and trends in access to basic water services. This analysis provides insights into countries with the greatest challenges in water accessibility and highlights trends over recent years.

## Skills Used
- **Pandas**: Data cleaning, manipulation, and transformation
- **NumPy**: Efficient numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualisation for insights and trend analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigated patterns and trends in global water access

## Project Highlights
This analysis was driven by the following key questions:
1. **Which country has the highest percentage of urban population?**
2. **How does the percentage of the population with access to basic water services change over the years?**
3. **Which countries rely heavily on surface water sources?**
4. **Is there a relationship between total population and percentage of urban population?**
5. **Which country has the highest percentage of the population relying on unimproved water services?**

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a clearer picture of global water access challenges, identifying regions with the highest reliance on unimproved and surface water sources, as well as the variations in access to basic services over time. These insights could guide further research and decision-making around improving water access in under-resourced areas.
